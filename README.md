## Project Overview

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The aim of this project is to analyze and predict climate patterns using time series analysis techniques. This repository is a structured learning journey that introduces Python programming, explores time series methodologies, and culminates in a comprehensive project to predict future climate trends based on real-world data.

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1: Python Programming for Data Science

**Objective:** Gain familiarity with Python and essential data science libraries.

**Focus Areas:**
- Python basics (variables, loops, functions, and data structures)
- Data manipulation with Pandas (loading, cleaning, and transforming data)
- Data visualization using Matplotlib (creating basic plots and visualizing trends)
- Numerical computations with NumPy (working with arrays and mathematical operations)

**Outcome:** Develop foundational skills necessary for data analysis and visualization. By the end of this week, you should be comfortable using Python for data manipulation and visualization tasks.

### Week 2: Introduction to Time Series Analysis

**Objective:** Understand basic time series concepts and implement foundational models.

**Focus Areas:**
- Introduction to time series data (understanding timestamps, frequency, and trends)
- Implementing linear regression for trend analysis
- Computing and visualizing simple moving averages (SMA) for trend smoothing
- Basic time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, and residuals)

**Outcome:** Build intuition for identifying patterns and trends in time series data. Youâ€™ll be able to analyze a time series dataset and use basic models for trend detection.

---

### Week 3: Advanced Time Series Techniques

**Objective:** Dive deeper into advanced time series methods and statistical analysis.

**Focus Areas:**
- Stationarity tests (e.g., Dickey-Fuller test) to check if a time series is stable over time
- Building ARIMA and SARIMA models for forecasting
- Evaluating models using metrics such as AIC, BIC, and RMSE
- Exploring cost functions for optimization and model refinement

**Outcome:** Develop the ability to choose and evaluate the best time series models for various datasets. By the end of this week, you should be able to apply ARIMA, SARIMA, and other time series methods to real-world data.

---

### Week 4: Final Project

**Objective:** Perform end-to-end time series analysis on a climate change dataset.

**Focus Areas:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, and normalization)
- Data visualization to uncover insights and present findings
- Implementing and comparing various models (ARIMA, SARIMA, simple moving averages, etc.)
- Making future climate predictions based on the developed models

**Outcome:** Deliver a comprehensive report detailing the best model and its predictions for future climate trends. You will gain practical experience in preparing, analyzing, and forecasting time series data.

## Optional Work

This repository provides the foundation for a time series analysis project on climate change. Moving forward, you can expand the project by:

1. Using more advanced forecasting models such as Prophet or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to enhance prediction accuracy and handle more complex patterns in the data.
2. Exploring more complex datasets, such as incorporating climate-related variables like CO2 emissions, temperature anomalies, or precipitation levels, and conducting in-depth analysis for different climate-related predictions.
