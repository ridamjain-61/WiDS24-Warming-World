# Week 2: Introduction to Time Series Analysis

## Objective
Understand basic time series concepts and implement foundational models.

---

## Focus Areas

1. **Introduction to Time Series Data**
   - Understanding timestamps, frequency, and trends.
   
2. **Linear Regression for Trend Analysis**
   - Learn how to identify and fit linear trends to a time series dataset.

3. **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**
   - Compute and visualize SMA for trend smoothing.

4. **Basic Time Series Decomposition**
   - Break down a time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.

---

## Outcome
By the end of this week, you will:
- Build intuition for identifying patterns and trends in time series data.
- Be able to analyze a time series dataset and use basic models for trend detection.
